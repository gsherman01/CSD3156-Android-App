# How We Use Gemini – Team Rules

1. Always paste RULES.md first
2. Then paste PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
3. Then paste ONE task-specific prompt
4. Never combine multiple tasks in one prompt
5. Always review generated code before committing
6. Commit in small, logical steps

If Gemini suggests violating rules:
- Stop
- Correct it
- Re-prompt with clarification
